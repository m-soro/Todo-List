# To-do List App - a code along project

A simple to do list app.

## with a **few lines** of jQuery!

In this app, we learned about selecting and manipulating DOM elements using jQuery. It saved us time by avoiding writing loops.

## selectors that were covered in this module includes:

* $('*elementToSelect*')
* .on() *which will add click event listener to non existing elements*
* .toggleClass() *monitors the state and adds/removes the class*
* .parent() *will refer to the element's parent*
* event and event.stopPropagation() *event bubbling and how to stop it*
* key codes *by comparing the pressed key to 'which' to specify an action*
* .val() *get the value in an input or an element*
